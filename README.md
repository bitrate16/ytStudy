# Welcome to ytStudy repository

For the lab you'll need the notebook 'lab/youtube.ipynb' and the scripts it uses. 

## Installation instructions

Prerequesites:

1. MITMProxy (https://mitmproxy.org)
2. Mozila Firefox **and** any other browser
3. (optional) Python Plotly library - better framework than matplotlib

MITMProxy installation can be quite cumbersome (but the intallation instructions on their website are OK). 
If you have UNIX-based OS or Windows version greater than Home, you can install docker and download docker image from ravmike/ytstudy, i.e., do 

docker pull ravmike/ytstudy
